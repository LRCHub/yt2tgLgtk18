Killer, dipset

My man, DJ Nasty in the house tonight
C'mon
[Incomprehensible] ma

(Hey Lady)
I know you heard me in British rob
But I get you bracelets till ya wrist is throbbed
Just kissed the nob and put your meat
On my stick like a shish-kabob
(Hey Lady)
Out mingalin', heard that I blingy-bling
But I run the circus like ring-a-ling
I'm the king of things, and your man
He a homo like jing-a-ling, jing-a-ling

(Hey Lady)
That's life, hit 'em with the pow-ping, pow pow
.45 loud thing, look wild thing
I do wild things, make China stretch like Yoa Ming
(Hey Lady)
Ching chong like a higher chow main
I buy lango, ma, I don't need a nickel, naw
Oh you tickled, ma? 'Cause your nipples, huh
Comin' through your shirt, nearly ripped your bra

(Hey Lady)
I see the hate in your eyes, damn them boys is too fly
It's the way we roll up, rims all swoll up, ice all froze up, sing
(Hey)
And while you're actin' surprised, like we dough sellin' pies
They way we hold up, papi hole up, mami roll up, sing

(Hey Lady)
I know a school in work, but you need to be schooled in work
Put my 2 to work, I feelin' your shoes, your purse
You get low on dough, the few the first
(Hey Lady)
I don't need you high like I'm high
But shit, I need you fly like I'm fly
Fresh, Lui Vuitton ankle, pastel, Lui Vuitton rainbow

(Hey Lady)
Threw on the Kango, threw on Durango's
Not from the 'nati, but through on the Bengals
Moved on an angle, like a baler malodor, the two gon' tango
(Hey Lady)
Shake your body, mami, move your body, hottie
It's true on kamikaze, I'm movin' a mazarattie
They all polly, polly, voo boy dolly, dolly
I don't talk like the swolly mami

(Hey Lady)
I see the hate in your eyes, damn them boys is too fly
It's the way we roll up, rims all swoll up, ice all froze up, sing
(Hey)
And while you're actin' surprised, like we dough sellin' pies
They way we hold up, papi hole up, mami roll up, sing

(Hey Lady)
Lady, dry your panties, damn, she wanna right her family
Tell 'em Nad, I'm a dyper dandy and I got all type of candy
(Hey Lady)
What's that, Victoria's Secret? Here's La Perla, come peep it
This lingerie that you could honor a wonder woman, ouii, go on play

(Hey Lady)
Like Cam' watch, like Cam' ring
Like Cam' chain, like Cam' bling
Heard Cam' sing, if a damn fling
Goddamn mam', not a damn thing

(Hey Lady)
I see the hate in your eyes, damn them boys is too fly
It's the way we roll up, rims all swoll up, ice all froze up, sing
(Hey Lady)
And while you're actin' surprised, like we dough sellin' pies
They way we hold up, papi hole up, mami roll up, sing
(Hey)
