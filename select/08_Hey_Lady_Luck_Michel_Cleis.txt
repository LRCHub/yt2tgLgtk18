Hey Lady luck don't care about my pride
Hey Lady luck la-lays it down
I get this feeling I can dream tonight
Yeah I've been seein' all the signs
A dream no one can dream to undermine
This time I am gonna get it right
Hey Lady luck ain't playing on my side
Hey Lady luck ain't smiling down
Hey Lady luck don't care about my pride
Hey Lady luck la-lays it down
Sometimes I wish I could anesthetize
Bring up the lows bring down the highs
She is the one I need to sympathise
She is the one who sees me cry
And I've been waiting for her day and night
I know my lady is around
I would put everything I have on the line
And I won't get better odds than now
Hey Lady luck I need a little light
Hey Lady luck I need you now
Hey Lady luck you have to make it right
Hey Lady luck don't let me down
Hey Lady luck is standing by my side
Hey Lady luck won't let me down
Hey Lady luck shows me a better sign
Hey Lady luck la-lays it down
A dream no one can dream to undermine
This time I am gonna get it right
I get this feeling I can dream tonight
Yeah I've been seein' all the signs
Hey Lady luck you saved my life tonight
Hey Lady luck I owe you now
Hey Lady luck I'll be a better guy
Lady I'll share your luck around
Hey Lady luck is standing by my side
Hey Lady luck won't let me down
Hey Lady luck shows me a better sign
Hey Lady luck la-lays it down
